<h3> <i>Bouny Ball</i>, Processing, 2020 </h3>
  <p> This was created using creative coding through Processing. I followed a tutorial on
      youtube called Bouncing Ball by a channel named "dante". This tutorial instructed on
      how to create an ellipse and have it move throughout the screen leaving an array of
      colors. This tutorial helped me create this colorful and moving artwork. </p>
