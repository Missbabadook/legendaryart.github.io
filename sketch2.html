<h3> <i>Ferris Wheel</i>, Processing, 2020 </h3>
<h3> Dimensions: 900 x 900 px </h3>
  <p> I made this circle of flashy circles through Processing. I followed a tutorial on
      youtube called Circle Patter with an Array of Colors by a channel named "thedotisblack creative coding".
      This tutorial instructed me on how to create a circular formation of dots and how to add
      color and movement to make it flashy and included how to add mouse interactivity. This tutorial helped
      me create this colorful and moving circular pattern. Drag your mouse from left to right within
      the black space. I experimented with the colors that made it range from light and dark grayish blues with
      soft hues of purple.</p>
