    <h3> <i>Charlie</i>, Blender, 2018 </h3>
    <p> This is a 3D model of my first character that I made using Blender while
        in a computer animation class. His name is Charlie and my inspirations for this
        character was Bart, from The Simpsons, and Animal Crossing. The inspiration behind
        his story resembles Narnia. The story behind this character was that he was a
        mischevious boy who recently moved into a new, small town. His parents leave him to
        explore his their new house. He looks around his room and finds a new world hidden
        behind the wall of his closet. The young and curious Charlie explore these new lands
        only to get into some trouble resulting in him scurrying his way back into his world.
