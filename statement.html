<h1>Statement</h1>
<div class="portfolio-item">
<p>Art is passion, expression, and wonder.
I love creating different kinds of art by experimenting with a range of both traditional and digital mediums. My goal as an artist is to inspire others and bring them the same joy that other artists have brought me. My greatest motivations for art is the experience of creation, self expression, and video games. Video games have been a great source of inspiration for me for most of my life. I graduated from Clovis Community College with an AA in Studio Arts, have experience in creating digital illustrations using AutoDesk Sketchbook and modeling 3D objects using Blender. I have also been experimenting with Adobe Lightroom and Premiere. My career goal is to graduate with a BFA in Digital Media Art as a game designer.
