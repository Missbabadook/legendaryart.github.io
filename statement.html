<p> Art is passion, expression, and wonder. I feel that art is sentimental. As an artist,
  I like to use my creative process to tell a story, set a scene, express emotion, and
  convey a message, which can be achieved in many ways. Expressing myself through art
  allows me to share how I feel emotionally and mentally as well expressing something from
  my perspective. I utilize art to capture meaningful moments, intriguing subconscious thoughts,
  struggles, and aspirations in my life. I currently have no medium of choice, but I prefer to
  have a diversity of experimenting with both traditional and digital mediums. I feel that
  being in DMA will take my art to new heights and bring out more of my potential. Despite having
  more experience in studio art, I hope to grow as a digital artist as well.</p>

  At first, my goal as an artist was to inspire others and bring them the same joy and creativity
  that other artists have brought me. I went into community college with no artistic experience,
  but eventually majored in studio art and continue to practice studio art. My goal as a studio artist
  is to be able to use my materials to create a narrative and portray feelings associated with the story of each work.
  My favorite materials to use are color pastels, charcoal, micron, cardboard and wire. I love working with collage
  and drawings, both involving two-dimensional and three-dimensional design. In community college, I had some experience
  in digital art by using blender and illustrator. When I came into SJSU I took more digital media art based classes and
  became familiarized with programs such as processing, adobe premiere pro, audacity, and twine. A goal I have as
  a digital media artist is to utilize technology in a way that puts the viewer in a story and the narrative is
  based on their interpretation. My current goal as an artist is to be more well rounded in studio art and digital media art.</p>

  Achieving balance of composition and being able to express what I want has proven to be one of my greatest challenges as an artist.
  My greatest motivations for art comes from the experience of creation, self expression, and video games. My main inspirations for my
  art are loved ones, life experiences, and video games. Video games have been a great source of inspiration for me for most of my life
  because it was something I grew up with and is something that is still involved in my life.</p>

  I graduated from Clovis Community College with an AA in Studio Arts, Two-Dimensional Design and have experience in creating
  digital illustrations using AutoDesk Sketchbook. I have experience in  modeling 3D objects using Blender. I have also been
  experimenting with Adobe Lightroom and Premiere. I have recently been introduced to creative coding with a couple of my works
  involving mouse interactivity using Processing. I have also been creating glitch art through Audacity. Overall, I want to primarily
  become more familiar with digital media art and become more efficient in 3D modeling/animation, programming, video editing and photoshop.
  My career goal is to graduate with a BFA in Digital Media Art and become a game designer.</p>
