<h3> <i>Color Squares</i>, Processing, 2020 </h3>
  <p> This was created using creative coding through Processing. I followed a tutorial on
      youtube called Hello Rectangle by a channel named "dante". This tutorial introduced
      how to create shapes, add color and mouse interactivity. Through this I was able to
      make this visual piece I call Color Squares. Drag your mouse across the screen
      within the grey area.</p>
